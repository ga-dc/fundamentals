## Check-in

Now's a good time for you to have your first check-in with one of our mentors. Most of our mentors are WDI grads who were in your shoes not too long ago. You can share your code, ask them for another explanation of any difficult concepts, or just chat with them about their experience in the course! You can connect with them at any time, and we've loaded up your account with an hour of credit to use as you need.

If you've already received your login credentials from your producer, <a href="https://ga.hackhands.com">head on over</a> to the GA Mentors site to get started.
