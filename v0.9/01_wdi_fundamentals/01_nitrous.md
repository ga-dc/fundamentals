**WDI Fundamentals Chapter 1**

# Setting Up Your Nitrous Box

We're going to be writing quite a few programs throughout this course. For some of your exercises, you'll be writing into files on your local computer, and executing them on the command line (we'll explain). For the mini-projects and assessment, you'll be making use of a service called [Nitrous](http://nitrous.io).

Nitrous effectively creates a computer for us in "the cloud" (yes, THE
cloud) that is all set up to run Ruby programs for us! "Well," you may ask, "if
this computer is in 'the cloud', how do we use it? How do we interact with it?"
It turns out that Nitrous also allows you to use this computer through their
website! Using a command line (more on this later) and a text editor, we will
be able to use this computer almost as if it were our own. You may not be able
to play Command and Conquer on this computer, but you sure can write and run
some Ruby programs.

Nitrous likes to call the computers they create for you "boxes". Follow these
steps to set up a Nitrous box for your work during this course.

Create an account on the [Nitrous website](http://nitrous.io)

Visit your dashboard (Click "Open Dashboard")

![Nitrous dashboard](../images/nitrous_01.png)

You should be taken to a screen where you can create a new box.

![Nitrous new box](../images/nitrous_02.png)

* Select the "Ruby/Rails" template
* Name your box
  * Use the format "[month]-[year]-wdi-[city]-[first]-[last]"
  * e.g. "11-2014-wdi-dc-john-smith"
  * The name is important, because later on, you're going to submit your work through this box (more later)
* Select a region closest to you
* Leave the "Download a GitHub repo" field blank
* Click "Create Box"

Your box should now be processing. After a short while, it will be `running`, as shown below.

Go ahead and click Next once your box is running.

You should now be taken to your box's IDE, or Integrated Development
Environment.

In essence, this is the environment that we'll be using to interact with this computer. This screen features a simple text editor, a command line interface (more on this soon) and a chat window (used if you have collaborators on this machine). These are the tools that we will use to create files, write programs, and run programs.

Once you've got your Nitrous box set up, you're ready to start tackling this course!

### Closing and returning to your Nitrous box

When you quit your Nitrous IDE and want to revisit it, log into Nitrous with
your account and open your Dashboard. You should see a list of your boxes.

Click your box to expand some options.

Clicking `IDE` will take you back to your familiar development environment.
Happy coding!
