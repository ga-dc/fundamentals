That said, we wanted to make sure that even now you have someone to reach out to you when you get stuck. We've enlisted a number of former WDI graduates to make themselves available to help you as you work through this book via a virtual platform. In fact, we'd like to ask you to take advantage of these mentors' guidance at least twice as you work through the material (we'll remind you to do a check-in at various points).

Your login for this service should have been sent to you in a separate email. If you haven't received these credentials, please email your GA producer. Once signed up, you can [login on the GA Mentors site](https://ga.hackhands.com) and then click the button below to request help at any time.
