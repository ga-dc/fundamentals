#### Additional Resources

Different applications have specific keyboard shortcuts to perform special
functions in that application. For example, `Cmd+T` in Sublime Text (a popular
text editor) opens a search box to find files inside your current project.
Make sure to learn application-specific shortcuts to streamline your workflow
as much as possible.

[Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) is a great software application to manage your window positions
on your screen using keyboard shortcuts, instead of dragging and resizing
windows using your mouse.

[A Cheat Sheet](http://edge-cache.lifehacker.com/lifehacker/lh_mac_shortcuts_update.pdf) for essential MacOSX keyboard shortcuts.

The [Treehouse Command Line Tutorial](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) is a
great resource to take another pass at learning the command line.

We recommend you work on improving your [typing speed](https://typing.io/lessons) over the next two weeks, as well. You should target a speed of 40 WPM on the [Ruby on Rails](https://typing.io/lesson/ruby/rails/relation.rb/1) exercise.
